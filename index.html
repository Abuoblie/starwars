       <h2>It is a period of civil war. Rebel spaceships, striking from a hidden base, have won their first victory against the evil Galactic Empire.
       During the battle, Rebel spies managed to steal secret plans to the Empire's ultimate weapon, the DEATH STAR, an armored space station with enough power to destroy an entire planet.
       Pursued by the Empire's sinister agents, Princess Leia races home aboard her starship, custodian of the stolen plans that can save her people and restore freedom to the galaxy....
       The dead speak! The galaxy has heard a mysterious broadcast, a threat of REVENGE in the sinister voice of the late EMPEROR PALPATINE.
       GENERAL LEIA ORGANA dispatches secret agents to gather intelligence, while REY, the last hope of the Jedi, trains for battle against the diabolical FIRST ORDER.
       Meanwhile, Supreme Leader KYLO REN rages in search of the phantom Emperor, determined to destroy any threat to his power....
       It all began with a space-opera film shown in 1977 that was originally a one-off deal. Until it opened several possibilities that led to the creation of prequels and sequels. Then it became more than just a show.
      
       Star Wars expanded its borders through its lore that attracted several other forms. Television series, video games, comic books, novels and, alternate storylines led to the creation of a vast, all-encompassing fictional universe. Stories made to this day were a testament to the limitless potential of the galaxy far, far away. The many forms Star Wars has taken were recognized as one of the highest-grossing media franchises of all time.</h2>
