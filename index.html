                Everything starts when I decided to make an inscription to update myself and do not lose my skills coding<br>
                then I make a test woth few more people to see if I was able to pass and finaly start to study web development <br>
          then finaly 5th of January arrived <br>
          and the course started,first day I met new people that was able to pass at the test like me <br>
          and we started to see about what we will learn and etc.<br>
          then we start to install git in your computers to do not have problems at home when we "work by ourselves"<br>
          then working homeoffice we start working in group of 4 make some projects and etc..<br> 
          after we have a solo project where we need to develope an website using Markdown,Html and CSS<br>
          that was great for me I really like develope and challenges as well<br>
          at the moment we are creating a new challenge that is make the Stars wars project working like in the movie<br>
          this work is in pairs and everything that we are doing in here we can count on the colleagues to help always that is needed<br> 
          and this is not the END...<br>
