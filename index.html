                It is a period of civil war. Rebel spaceships, striking <br>from a hidden base, have won their first victory against
          the evil Galactic Empire.<br>
          During the battle, Rebel spies managed to steal secret plans to <br>the Empire's ultimate weapon, the DEATH STAR, an
          armored space station with enough power to destroy an entire planet.<br>
          Pursued by the Empire's sinister agents, Princess Leia races home aboard <br>her starship, custodian of the stolen plans
          that can save her people and restore freedom to the galaxy....<br>
          The dead speak! The galaxy has heard a mysterious broadcast, a threat<br> of REVENGE in the sinister voice of the late
          EMPEROR PALPATINE.<br>
          GENERAL LEIA ORGANA dispatches secret agents to gather intelligence,<br> while REY, the last hope of the Jedi, trains
          for battle against the diabolical FIRST ORDER.<br>
          Meanwhile, Supreme Leader KYLO REN rages in search of the phantom Emperor,<br> determined to destroy any threat to his
          power....<br>
          It all began with a space-opera film shown in 1977 that was originally<br> a one-off deal. Until it opened several
          possibilities that led to the<br> creation of prequels and sequels. Then it became more than just a show.<br>
      
          Star Wars expanded its borders through its lore that attracted several other forms. <br>Television series, video games,
          comic books, novels and, alternate storylines <br>led to the creation of a vast, all-encompassing fictional universe.<br>
          Stories made to this day were a testament to the<br> limitless potential of the galaxy far, far away. The many forms<br>
          Star Wars has taken were recognized as one of the highest-grossing media franchises of all time.
